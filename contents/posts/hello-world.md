I have always wanted to have a blog. Well, I did, many times. Back in 2008/09, I was about 16 years old and had a WordPress blog hosted on [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/). And in 2016, I used a popular static site generator (I can't recall the name) and wrote some posts on it. I have to say I am annoyed by the versatility of static site generators - they have so many out-of-the-box features and tons of documentation - but only a few I need.

On the other hand, I am not familiar with CSS. These static site generators have many fancy themes contributed by the community. Whenever I applied one of them, I always wanted to have some subtle changes and finally gave up as I always made things uglier.

This year I wrote many notes about tech, reading, and all kinds of stuff. I plan to convert them into articles for someone to understand a specific topic better. That is why I am building this site.

Using something I am familiar with and some not to build things is fun - a bit challenging, but not having the foggiest idea. I have learnt [the basic concept of CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), combined with Python and Jinja2 to generate these web pages.

It is still a toy, but I will call it a workable MVP. I might share how I built each function in the next few weeks.
